# ProfileLauncher
A utility to launch a Roblox profile from the command line or desktop.

## Usage
### From the Desktop
Double click the executable and enter a username.
### From the Command Line
```ProfileLauncher [options]```
#### Options:
`-u, --username`: Pass in a username as an argument, bypassing the need to type it in when ProfileLauncher is launched.

`--version`: Prints the version of the program.

`--help`: Displays a list of options.

## Putting ProfileLauncher on your PATH
Putting ProfileLauncher on your path is a good idea if you want to be able to run it from anywhere you can input a command, for example, on Windows, this enables ProfileLauncher to be launched just by typing `profilelauncher` into the Run dialog. If you plan to only run it from a desktop shortcut or a specific folder, then this is not nessecary.
### Windows
1. Download the latest respective executable for your system from the [releases](https://github.com/CominAtYou/ProfileLauncher/releases) page.
2. **Rename the executable to `profilelauncher`**.
3. Type `%localappdata%\Programs` into the File Explorer address bar and hit enter. In here, create a folder called `ProfileLauncher`.
4. Move the executable you downloaded into the folder you just created.
5. Open Control Panel, and search for `Environment Variables`.
6. Select `Edit environment variables for your account`.
7. Under `User variables`, select Path and click `Edit`.
8. Click `New` and type in the file path of the folder you created.
### macOS
1. Download the latest macOS executable from the [releases](https://github.com/CominAtYou/ProfileLauncher/releases) page.
2. **Rename the executable to `profilelauncher`**.
3. Copy the executable.
4. Press âŒ˜+Shift+G while in Finder, and type `/usr/local/bin`.
5. Paste the executable you copied in here, and enter your password if prompted.
### Linux
1. Download the latest respective Linux executable for your machine from the [releases](https://github.com/CominAtYou/ProfileLauncher/releases) page.
2. **Rename the executable to `profilelauncher`**.
3. Move the executable to `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` if you want to make it available for every user. Some distrobutions (like Arch) forgo adding `~/.local/bin` to PATH by default, so if you opt for the former, you may need to manually add `/home/your_username/.local/bin` to your PATH variable.
## Building Yourself
You will need Node.js installed to build. You will also need PowerShell Core if you are not on Windows and are not building manually.
### Automated build
1. Install tsc and pkg:

    ```
    npm i -g typescript pkg
    ```
2. Compile the TypeScript source into JavaScript:

    ```
    tsc
    ```
3. Run build.ps1.
### Manual Build
1. Clone the repository
2. Install tsc and pkg:

    ```
    npm i -g typescript pkg
    ```
3. Compile the TypeScript source into JavaScript:

    ```
    tsc
    ```
4. Compile the JavaScript into an executable:

    ```
    pkg index.js --target=YOUR_TARGET_HERE --output=DESIRED_FILE_NAME
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_TARGET_HERE` with one of the following in the 'target' column:
    | Operating System | Target |
